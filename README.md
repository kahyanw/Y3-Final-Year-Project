# Y3-Final-Year-Project

The aim of my project is to obtain the best subsetof genes that distinct the classification of AML and ALL. 
I will be applying the idea of symbots toconduct a solution search to find the best fitted subset.

A symbot as described in this paper are simulations of three-dimensional robots in a 2D
space, taking the form of artificial life. The symbot has wheels that facilitates movement around
the search space and has sensors to detect the field strength of possible solutions around the
symbot. The symbot then takes the best solutions based on the intensity of the field strength.

The solutions obtained from the symbot search are then used to form a population of genes,
becoming chromosomes for a simple genetic algorithm. In this process, the subset of genes will
undergo crossover and mutation with other subset of genes to create the best population of
genes.
